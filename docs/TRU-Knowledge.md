# Tomb Raider: Underworld - game knowledge base

What the project learned about the game itself (PC 1.1, Xbox 360 retail and title update, DLC 1 *Beneath the Ashes*, DLC 2 *Lara's Shadow*) from its data and code, written at game level: what happens, under which conditions, with which numbers.
Status: ✅ proven from data / code or seen live · 🔶 inferred · ⬜ open. Where a later finding corrected an earlier one only the corrected fact is listed, marked "(corrected)".
Technical detail (addresses, structs, tools) is in [ENGINE.md](ENGINE.md); the Source column names its section and row, a repo doc, or a `Befund-*` finding report (kept outside this repo, named only).

## 1. Structure

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Units | The world is cut into stream units (one `.drm` each). The PC unit list has 119 units: base levels l1-l7 with 23 / 16 / 9 / 11 / 6 / 6 / 13, DLC 1 12, DLC 2 11 | ✅ | ENGINE §4.1 "Unit list" |
| Units without data | `dlc_level1_left` / `_right` and `dlc_level3_start` .. `dlc_level6_start` are listed but exist in no archive on any platform (four never-built DLC slots) | ✅ | ENGINE §4.1 "Units without a DRM" |
| Streaming | Up to 32 units are resident. Stream portals link units; crossing one makes the target the main unit and loads its neighbours (portals with the auto-load flag) | ✅ | ENGINE §4.1, §4.2 |
| Level change | A level change (story end, mission start, death reload) runs on the main thread behind the loading screen; PC loads took 23-38 s (median 32 s). A death reload waits at least 3 s | ✅ live | ENGINE §3 "Level load loop", §4.2 "Reload after death" |
| Look-through portals | A few portals (DLC 1, base `l2_cliffhall_b` <-> `l2_hubhall`) name a unit two rooms away; Lara never walks through them - read as preload / look-through portals | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| Cells and stream groups | Inside a unit the scene is split into cells; when Lara enters another cell the game loads the stream groups (material / texture sets) that the cell's list names, also from neighbour units | ✅ | ENGINE §16 "Cell stream lists" |
| Sonar maps | Each unit has a separate `<unit>_map.drm` collision mesh used only by the PDA sonar | ✅ | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar map (ping map) build" |
| Navigation | Enemy paths use the unit's NavPower mesh. Hand-made "custom" areas exist only in DLC 1 (209 areas, mostly facing down or steep = walls / ceilings for spiders 🔶). Units with bats or sharks also carry a 3D graph | ✅ | ENGINE §15 "Data statistics", "3D image (Level+0x68)" |
| Objects | Units place objects as intros; an object loads its children (weapons, dismemberment pieces, companions) after itself | ✅ | ENGINE §5.1 "Object request / load end" |
| Shared ids | For data ids (DTPs, animations, materials) the first loaded copy wins; a later file with the same id uses that copy | ✅ | ENGINE §5.1 "Id tables: first loaded copy wins" |
| Scripts | Object scripts run per instance; their variables are lost on reload unless they are "stickies" (persistent int / bool / float) | ✅ | ENGINE §6.1 "What is saved and what is not" |
| Puzzle objects | Movable puzzle parts are uber objects: a state graph whose transitions fire on time, commands, damage, impacts or joint angles (degrees) / slider positions (units). Multi-part puzzles test the node of linked parts | ✅ | ENGINE §9 "Event / command delivery (Q74)", "Object check cond 9" |
| Triggers | Trigger volumes (box or sphere) send enter / leave / inside events; trigger planes and stream portals are crossing tests. The test point is 200 units above Lara's feet | ✅ | ENGINE §11 "Volume = two points, no sweep (Q73)" |
| Trigger scripts | A trigger volume's "first in" runs once per save (sticky); "in" / "out" run on every crossing | ✅ | ENGINE §11 "Trigger volume base script 3484 (Q73)" |
| Cinematics | A cinematic object plays once (sticky "played"); trigger volumes can preload it before the playing trigger is reached | ✅ | ENGINE §11 "Cinematic base script 3523 (Q73)" |
| Game time | Logic runs in ticks of 1/30 s; one frame is capped at 2 ticks, so below 15 fps the game slows down instead of stepping further | ✅ | ENGINE §11 "Frame time clamp (Q73)" |
| Physics | 405 bodies / 1200 geoms / 300 joints; variable time step, 5 solver iterations; below ~26 fps each frame runs as two half steps | ✅ | ENGINE §13.6 "Physics frame step (Q69)", "MultibodySystem::Step" |
| Scale | About 290 units per metre (280-310; Lara's bind mesh is 511 units tall) (corrected: not 100 per metre) | 🔶 | ENGINE §4.3 |

## 2. Level order

### 2.1 Base game

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chain | Levels end in cinematics that start the next level: prologue `l3_main_hall` -> `l1_seatop` (Mediterranean) -> ship sinking -> `l2_cliffclimb` (Thailand) -> `l3_caverns_start` (Croft Manor) -> `L4_trailstart` (Mexico) -> `L5_startsnow` (Jan Mayen) -> `L6_ship_exterior` -> `L7_thin_ice` (Arctic) | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "Base-game level chain (Q113)" |
| Inside a level | Only stream portals; the cinematic numbers never fall along the chain (101 visits over 81 units). Two portals between one unit pair are parallel doors with their own checkpoints | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "Base-game level chain (Q113)" |
| Revisits | The prologue units are revisited after level 3 starts; Mediterranean returns from the kraken room to the boat; Mexico returns from the pool to the ballcourt | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "Base-game level chain (Q113)" |
| Chapters | Chapters per level: 1 = 5, 2 = 4, 3 = 1, 4 = 4, 5 = 2, 6 = 1, 7 = 3, plus the prologue | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "Chapter title card" |
| End | The game ends in `l7_monastery` (its script ends the game). `l7_himalaya_end` holds a 59 s extended ending `343_hel_engame` that the shipped scripts never reach | ✅ data / ⬜ live | ENGINE §8.2 "Extended ending" |
| Mediterranean start | Lara starts on the yacht, a fixed object that never moves; she surfaces wherever she crosses the wide seafloor portal (~65 m below the surface) and swims back to it | ✅ data + log | ENGINE §11 "Mediterranean boat (W4)" |

### 2.2 DLC 1 *Beneath the Ashes*

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry | New game loads `dlc_level1_start`, plays the intro `010_intro`; its end warps Lara straight to a `dlc_caverns` checkpoint (no portal) | ✅ live | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| Walked order | level1_start -> caverns -> caverns_hall -> water_wheel -> watertunnel -> dungeon -> dungeonhalla -> pillory (corrected: not the portal-graph order) | ✅ live | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| Second visits | Scripts stage a second pass of water_wheel ("bats pass 2"), pillory ("visit 2") and dungeon, and route through `dlc_dungeonhallb` | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| End | After the four goo-pit gates are closed a dungeon portal leads to `dlc_treasureroom`; its trigger plays `030_finale`, after 2.8 s the movie `credits_DLC1` runs, then the main menu | ✅ live | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| Placement | In every DLC 1 unit the player start lies 5-11 m from the portal Lara first enters through | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 level chain (PK.1)" |
| Golden shotgun | The DLC 1 reward weapon is picked up in `dlc_dungeon` and shown on the PDA weapon pages | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "Golden shotgun (884)" |
| Default outfit | DLC 1 units default to `dlc_costume_f` | ✅ data | ENGINE §19 |

### 2.3 DLC 2 *Lara's Shadow*

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Player | The player is the Doppelganger (`doppelganger_casual`); DLC 2 units default to the `lara_doppelganger` costume | ✅ data | ENGINE §19 |
| Entry | The mission screen loads `dlc_level2_start` by name; the intro `000_fight` ends with Lara in the same unit (unlike DLC 1) | ✅ live | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 level chain (PK1-8)" |
| Front part | level2_start -> `dlc_yggdrasil_hall01` -> `hall02` (tutorial fight) -> `dlc_yggdrasil_end`; the three Yggdrasil rooms are the base-game rooms reused, the start unit is a rebuilt `l7_yggdrasil` | ✅ live / data | ENGINE §8.2; Befund-Sonar-DLC2-1411 |
| Into the ring | A trigger in `dlc_yggdrasil_end` plays `020_ghoul` (32 s), which loads `dlc2_ceremony_room` by name; front (4 units) and ring (7 units) share no portal | ✅ live log | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 cinematics" |
| Ring | ceremony -> hall_ceremony_goo -> goo_room -> hall_goo_machine -> machine_room -> hall_machine_ceremony -> ceremony, walked twice | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 level chain (PK1-8)" |
| Objective counter | Scripts broadcast an objective count that orders the mission: 2 at the start, 3 hall02, 4 end room, 5 at `030_pod`, ... 31 at the last ceremony trigger | ✅ data, live 2-6 | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 level chain (PK1-8)" |
| End | Count 31 plays `040_podon`, then `045_finale` in `dlc2_treasure_room_cine`; the capsule switches start `050_crush` and the movie `credits_DLC2` | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 level chain (PK1-8)" |
| hall02 tutorial | The wall opens when the tutorial reached stage 2 and no thrall is alive; stage 2 comes from the combat hints (first kick) or, as fallback, three thrall deaths. Generator limit 7 thralls | ✅ live | ENGINE §8.1 |

## 3. Lara: moves and combat

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lock-on | LT holds a hard lock (lock time 8 from the player data), RT aims / fires; without a living target only a soft lock is possible | ✅ | ENGINE §13.7 "Lock-on path (aiming, record 718)" |
| Target switch | While hard-locked, a right-stick push past 0.2 (after 3 / 12 tick timers) searches a new target in that direction and plays a sound | ✅ | ENGINE §13.7 "Lock-on target switch (Q68)" |
| Adrenaline meter | Max 500. It fills with the health Lara takes off enemies and drains 20 per second (225 per second in adrenaline mode) | ✅ | ENGINE §13.7 "Adrenaline fill (Q77, group F)", "Adrenaline meter (Q65)" |
| Adrenaline mode | R3 (press) with meter > 0, a hard lock on a target, no weapon in slot 3 and no strike running; Lara's time ramps to 0.5. Without a target R3 only plays a fail sound (corrected: a full meter is not needed) | ✅ | ENGINE §13.7 "Adrenaline mode, vault-off strike, headshot circle (Q108)" |
| Adrenaline mode end | The entry conditions are checked every tick while the mode runs: as soon as one fails (LT released, the hard lock or its target lost, meter empty) the mode ends at once. R3 without LT is also a separate chart action, so the mode is never started from R3 alone | ✅ static | ENGINE §13.7 "Adrenaline mode without a target, strike without X (0.6.15 test switches)" |
| Adrenaline without drain | The meter drains only in one place, as rate x time; with both drain rates scaled to 0 (TruShadowCombat percents) it keeps its exact value in and out of the mode. The mode then still ends when LT is released or the lock / target is lost, and a strike outside the mode still empties the meter. A "refill" that tops up only outside the mode (TruMenu "Nach Einsatz auffüllen") lets the bar drain during the mode and fills it after. In the DLC 2 doppelganger mode the meter and the mode do not run at all (as on the Xbox) | ✅ static | ENGINE §13.7 "Adrenaline meter (Q65)", "Adrenaline stays full (0.22.49)" |
| Vault-off strike | X held while hard-locked with a **full** meter on a valid enemy: the strike prompt shows, Lara vaults off the enemy (enemy -> Vaulted), the meter empties. Without a full meter: feedback sound, no move | ✅ | ENGINE §13.7 "Vault-off strike entry (group L)" |
| Headshot circle | During the strike a circle appears; the pointer starts at a random point and moves with the right stick (and mouse). Pointer inside the circle + RT = headshot | ✅ / radius ⬜ | ENGINE §13.7 "Adrenaline mode ...", "Strike circle radius source" |
| Headshot damage | A headshot hit uses the enemy's head-hit data, multiplies the damage by an enemy-specific percentage and resets its regeneration | ✅ / values ⬜ | ENGINE §13.7 "Headshot damage (group L)" |
| Damage types | 0 Light, 1 Medium, 2 Heavy, 4 Explosion, 6 RigidBody, 8 Falling, 10 Fire, 11 Stamina; DLC 2 adds 17 (shadow step), 18-25 (combo), 26 / 27 (shadow moves) | ✅ | ENGINE §13.3 "Type names" |
| DLC 2 combo | Punches on X (four in a chain), kicks via Y. Measured TU hit values: punches 20 / 40 / 60, kicks 130 / 100 / 70 | ✅ live (Xenia) | ENGINE §1 "Lara's punch combo (K-8)" |
| Finisher | On a lying thrall Y starts a finisher leap; its distance is the animation's root motion (~600 units) | ✅ live | ENGINE §12 "Finisher Y move: state 1008" |
| Falling | Gravity about -5151 units/s², speed cap ~411 000 u/s; there is no kill plane below hall02 (a 125 s fall was logged) | ✅ live | ENGINE §12 "Player fall state" |
| Wall run (DLC 2) | Runs along walls only while the shadow power is on; stick direction picks the run and jump-off branches; without power Lara drops | ✅ | ENGINE §14 "Wall run chart (DLC 2)" |
| Rock veins (DLC 2) | With LB/RB + A Lara jumps to and climbs rock veins; the meter drains while she hangs and she falls when it is empty | ✅ (Xenia) | DLC2.md "Doppelgänger / shadow power" |
| Breath | Air (capacity value 4000) refills only when the diving gear item sits in its slot; the tank item is only a model | ✅ | ENGINE §20.6 "Breath", "Player data block" |
| Gear | 13 gear kinds: binoculars (field camera), healthpack, grapple, sticky bomb, personal light, gauntlets, belt, diving gear, lighter, PDA, diving tanks, right gauntlet | ✅ | ENGINE §20.6 "Gear families" |
| Default gear | Each unit gives a default weapon / gear list; Mediterranean: handgun, speargun, binoculars, grapple, grenades, PDA, light, diving gear, lighter - no tanks (a start scene gives them) | ✅ data | ENGINE §20.6 "Default gear per unit" |
| Grapple | A grappled object goes back to its placed position when the area is saved / unloaded and its home unit is loaded | ✅ | ENGINE §6.4 "Live updates during play" |
| Scripted adrenaline moments | The base game slows world / player time itself in scripted adrenaline scenes (one script in 28 base DRMs) (corrected: no DLC script does this) | ✅ data | ENGINE §20.2 |

## 4. Shadow power (DLC 2)

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Activation | Hold LB or RB; the power runs while one is held | ✅ live | ENGINE §21 "Shadow power keys on PC (W7)" |
| Numbers | Meter max 1000, drains 200 / s (5 s), refills 200 / s, restarts only from 150 after running empty; world speed 0.3, player speed 1.2 | ✅ data | ENGINE §20.1 "858 tuning" |
| Look | Screen blur and brightening while active; HUD silhouette (shadow meter) next to the weapon widget | ✅ (Xenia) | DLC2.md "Xbox reference" |
| Needed for | The first rock vein after the start and five puzzles (grinders, vents, eitr serpent heads, floating blocks, deadly rain) need the slow motion | 🔶 | DLC2.md |
| Meter at start | The title-update code shows the meter full when DLC 2 starts | ✅ static / Xbox not seen ⬜ | ENGINE §20.2 "Meter init HUD store (W7)" |
| Vaulted enemies | An enemy knocked into Vaulted runs at normal speed for 5 s while the world is slowed | ✅ static | ENGINE §13.7 "Vaulted clock" |

## 5. Enemies and AI

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enemy kinds | 26 objects with enemy data: base 21 (sharks, mercenaries, poachers, bats, tiger, panthers, nagas, spiders, tarantulas, Mayan / viking / yeti thralls), DLC 1 knight thrall, DLC 2 four viking / yeti thrall kinds | ✅ data | ENGINE §13.1 "Enemy kinds and what they load (Q83)" |
| Behaviour types | Creature, CreatureVolumetric (bats, sharks - need the 3D graph), Thrall, Soldier | ✅ | ENGINE §13.1 "Behaviour tree byte" |
| Health | Enemy health comes from its tuning record scaled by the "EnemyHP" difficulty step; a viking thrall has 350 | ✅ live | ENGINE §13.1 "LP at birth (Q86)" |
| Regeneration | A lethal hit on a thrall lays it down to regenerate (yeti 300 ticks = 10 s, tutorial viking 210 = 7 s) instead of killing it; hits while lying push attached pieces | ✅ | ENGINE §13.4 |
| Finisher hint | The first lethal hit on a regenerating enemy shows the finisher hint once | ✅ live | ENGINE §7.3 "Notification ids" |
| Dismemberment | Dead thralls can break into pieces (chunkdoll); pieces vanish after 20 s (base) / 7.5 s (DLC 2), a flagged last piece stays for good and is saved | ✅ | ENGINE §13.6 "Data D", "Permanent piece (Q99)" |
| Hit reactions | A hit is light (hit animation) or heavy (knockback); DLC 2 thrall knockback forces per hit type 3 / 9 / 12 / 18 | ✅ static | ENGINE §13.7 "Hit struct selector", "Knockback force (K-1)" |
| Generators | Spawners keep max-alive and total limits, spawn in groups with pauses, never while Lara is within ~632 units of the spawner or a body lies at the spawn point; every retail generator starts switched off | ✅ | ENGINE §8.1 "Generator 10028 spawn", §10 "Intro data" |
| Drowning | Land enemies in deep water die a drown death | ✅ static | ENGINE §11 "Water volume intro data and water level (PW.1)" |
| Cinematics | Enemies switch to a "Puppet" state when a cinematic starts and return to idle afterwards | ✅ live | ENGINE §13.9 "State Puppet" |
| Melee chains | Enemy melee attacks can chain into linked follow-up attacks; an attack coordinator grants attack slots | ✅ / slot count ⬜ | ENGINE §13.4 "Attack coordinator", §13.5 |
| Debug cheats | One-hit-kill sets any damaged enemy to 0 health; an enemy-health text cheat exists | ✅ | ENGINE §13.3 "Health component", §23 "Cheats" |

## 6. PDA, sonar, hints, objectives

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sonar | The ping map casts rays (500 per frame) from Lara's eye (+200 units) to map vertices inside the ping radius; only geometry in range and in line of sight is drawn, plus pingable objects and portals in sight | ✅ static | Befund-Sonar-DLC2-1411; ENGINE §14 |
| Sonar maps DLC 2 | Real maps only in `dlc_yggdrasil_hall01` / `hall02` / `end` (copies of the base Yggdrasil maps); the start unit and all `dlc2_*` rooms carry a developer placeholder mesh spelling "MAP", so the sonar shows almost nothing there | ✅ data / Xbox 🔶 | Befund-Sonar-DLC2-1411 |
| Sonar maps DLC 1 / base | DLC 1 maps are real except `dlc_level1_start` and `dlc_treasureroom` (placeholder); the base game uses the same placeholder in five cinematic / corridor units | ✅ data | Befund-Sonar-DLC2-1411 |
| Sonar memory and limits | The sonar remembers per map point whether a ping revealed it (unknown / revealed / being checked) and keeps that in the save; it draws a face only when all its points are revealed. Opening the PDA loads every connected map room of the floor, but a ping checks only the current room and its direct neighbours. At most about 93 500 map triangles are drawn per frame - larger areas are cut | ✅ static | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar draw + full-map patch"; Befund-Sonar-Komplett-1411 |
| Sonar floors | Every sonar map carries floor bits; the PDA shows one floor at a time - the lowest floor bit of the room Lara stands in when it opens. It loads the rooms of that floor that are connected through portals plus their direct neighbours of other floors, but draws only the floor's rooms. Helheim: helheim01 floor mask 0x02, helheim02 0x06, helheim03 0x04, helheim_hall01 0x03, helheim_hall02 0x02, Yggdrasil 0x04 / 0x04 / 0x0c / 0x08 - opened in helheim03 the map stops at the doorway to helheim01. A room with a floor-change portal shows a marker; aiming the sonar view at a seen marker offers a button that switches the floor (the other floor loads, rooms off it are dropped) | ✅ data + static; button ⬜ | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar floors, load scope"; Befund-TruMenu-02249-1411 |
| Sonar triangle budget | The 93 572 triangles per frame are only a counter, not a buffer size: the map is sent in batches of 2000 into a vertex pool that grows on PC. Past the budget the rest is dropped in drawing order - the current room first, then the rooms by portal steps, inside a room in file order (so a cut room shows scattered pieces), and every marker / icon drawn after the map. In the DLC 1 water-wheel area the full floor (about 121 600 triangles) loses 23 % - the end of the water tunnel and all of the caverns | ✅ static + live count | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar floors, load scope" |
| Sonar map sizes, DLC 1 water-wheel area | Opened at the water wheel, the PDA loads 9 map rooms; normally it draws the 5 of Lara's floor (121 667 triangles). All 9 together are 250 909 triangles: water wheel 18 649, pillory 53 190, caverns hall 16 688, water tunnel 13 728, dungeon hall A 32 628, dungeon hall B 40 050, caverns 19 412, dungeon 56 464 and the DLC 1 start room 100 (only the "MAP" placeholder). The pillory and the dungeon alone are bigger than half the game's per-frame budget. Floors: water wheel and caverns hall floor 2, caverns 1+2, pillory 2+3, water tunnel 2+4, dungeon halls 3+4, dungeon 4, start room 5 | ✅ live (TruMenu 0.22.49 log, 2026-11-14) | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar floors, load scope" |
| Sonar on the Xbox | The Xbox (title update) runs the same sonar code: the same five modes, 500 ray tests per frame, the same per-point reveal memory and the same per-frame triangle budget (about 93 500) - big DLC 1 areas would be cut on the Xbox too, if that many triangles are revealed. TruXenia's Sonar page shows mode, rooms (real map or "MAP" placeholder), revealed share and the triangle counters live | ✅ static (TU); live ⬜ | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar TU twins"; TRUXENIA.md "Sonar" |
| Sonar and loading zones | The sonar's map rooms are separate files, loaded into the sonar's own list through the same file loader the level streaming uses, and all released when the PDA closes; the streamed level rooms are not touched. Showing the other floors' rooms that the sonar loaded anyway adds no load (TruMenu "Alle verbundenen Bereiche"); loading more floors would add files to the shared loader queue | ✅ static | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar floors, load scope" |
| Sonar look: colour, fog, cut | Every sonar map point gets the same colour (revealed cyan, unrevealed invisible); nothing on the CPU side depends on the distance. The sonar view sets the camera's far distance to 1 km and a fog whose start and end are the same distance, i.e. no usable fog - so the dimming of far rooms seen on the PC is not a normal distance fog (most likely the lighting of the sonar's map material; open). The view also cuts away everything more than 40 m in front of the point it looks at (towards the camera), so a room can vanish while the camera looks one way and appear when it turns. TruMenu 0.22.51 adds a real fog row, one-room view and a tint of the other rooms on top | ✅ static / ⬜ live | ENGINE §14 "PDA sonar view: colour, fog, cut plane, per-unit draw" |
| Help on demand | Lara's hint / answer lines (499 streams) are picked per level ("l0".."l7"). DLC 1 asks for "dlc_l1", which the PDA does not know, so DLC 1 has no help | ✅ chain / Xbox 🔶 | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 1 help-on-demand" |
| DLC 2 PDA | DLC 2 changes the PDA main / journal page, the weapon pages (golden shotgun) and adds a DLC journal menu with DLC room names | ✅ data | Befund-DLC2-PDA-1111 |
| PDA main menu per level | Base game and DLC 1 use the "Croft VX2" device PDA with seven entries: sonar map, area info, weapon selection, inventory, help, journal (in DLC 1 "Father's Journal") and revisit location. DLC 2 deliberately uses a journal-style PDA with only Objectives / Hints, Area Info and Controls: the same PDA page checks the level tag "dlc2", swaps the background art, rebuilds the menu with three entries and sends entry 1 to the DLC objectives page and entry 3 to a DLC 2 controls picture. This is already so in the February 2009 prototype, so the missing sonar entry in DLC 2 is a design choice, not an unfinished leftover. The sonar entry does nothing in the ship prologue units and in level 6. Area info shows a preview picture and the relic / treasure counts per level; DLC 1 and DLC 2 have their own preview pictures (only in the DLC PDA file) and their own count slots (DLC 2 on the Xbox: 1 relic, 20 treasures) | ✅ data + Xbox screenshots | ENGINE §8.2 "PDA main menu per level" |
| PDA on the PC (fork) | The fork's tree keeps the PC's own PDA file, which knows no DLC: DLC 1 and DLC 2 show the base device PDA (sonar map instead of Objectives, plain greyed "Journal", no area preview and empty relic / treasure counts because the PC PDA knows only the base levels, plus the PC's "Resume game"). The ported DLC 2 PDA is built but not installed | ✅ data + PC screenshots | ENGINE §8.2 "PDA main menu per level" |
| Base PDA in DLC 2 (switch) | The game keeps every loaded script in a table by its number; the PDA page's DLC 2 test is one tiny function that answers "yes" when the level tag is "dlc2". Making it answer "no" while the PDA is closed lets DLC 2 open the base device PDA (with the sonar map) instead of its journal PDA - possible only with the DLC PDA file, the PC's own PDA has no DLC 2 test at all (TruMenu 0.22.51 "Shadow-PDA durch Basis-PDA ersetzen") | ✅ static / ⬜ live | ENGINE §8.2 "Scripts by id at run time; base PDA switch" |
| PDA text transitions (crash 14.11.) | A PDA text element can carry transition groups; each record names its target element by name (a path of one or two names), and the game looks that name up among the PDA screen's own elements when the screen is set up - at a new game right after the intro. A name it cannot find gives back an empty object, and the game crashes when it uses it. The first installed DLC 2 PDA (14.11.) had 23 such paths still in the unconverted Xbox form (one-name paths slipped through the converter and the port tool), one of them in the base game's PDA screen: the new game crashed 7 seconds after Lara was placed; without that file the same plugins start fine. The PC's own PDA has all these paths in the converted form | ✅ crash dump + data (fix not yet played) | ENGINE §2 "UI text transition paths; one-element u16 paths" |
| Objective banner (DLC 2) | "Objective / hint revealed" banner: dark bar scales in within 1 s, text fades in by 2 s, holds to 6.5 s, gone at 7.5 s | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "DLC 2 objective / hint notifier" |
| DLC 2 hints | Tutorial hint boxes close on move notifications (e.g. the first kick closes the punch hint); which move sends which id is only partly known | 🔶 | ENGINE §8.1 "Hints", §7.3 |

## 7. Puzzles and world mechanics

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DLC 1 water | Only the sluice gate in `dlc_water_wheel` (second visit) sets the sticky `WaterFlowing`; the same action turns the wheel and starts the falls | ✅ static + log | ENGINE §11 "DLC 1 dungeon water flag WaterFlowing (W4)" |
| DLC 1 water level | With the flag the dungeon raises its water when it streams in or when Lara enters the lower basin: basin -1285 -> -120, sewer 252 -> 1520 (floor height); without it the water is lowered. New game resets it | ✅ static + log | ENGINE §11 (W4); Befund-W4-Wasser-Boot-1411 |

## 8. Loading screens, movies, cards, subtitles

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|

| DLC loading screen | Title in a ring, the description types itself in | ✅ (Xenia) | DLC2.md "Xbox reference" |
| Title card | The "Eidos presents" card of the first level runs on its own text animation without a background image | ✅ code | Befund-Ladebild-Hauptspiel-1411 |
| Chapter cards | Shown only by base-game cinematic objects; the DLC units never call them, so DLCs have no chapter cards | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "Chapter title card" |
| Movies | `intro`, `medsea_loop` (main menu background), `credits`, `credits_DLC1`, `explode`, `prevontr`; 4:3 screens use `_nw` variants; no cinema bars exist | ✅ static | ENGINE §23 "Code-played movies", "Front-end state" |
| Skipping | One-shot movies (credits) end on a click / key; the looping main-menu movie cannot be skipped | ✅ static | ENGINE §23 "Video player skip input (W3)" |
| Front end | Legal screens (script-drawn), intro movie, press start, main menu; after 40 s without input the attract teaser plays (`intro`) | ✅ | ENGINE §23 "Front-end state", "Attract timer" |
| Cutscene timing | A cutscene follows its sound stream's clock; without sound it runs on game time | ✅ static | ENGINE §3 "Cinematic stream clock" |
| Subtitles | Up to two lines; each new line shows at least 3 s (90 ticks) before scrolling up. One record holds all languages, each with its own cue times; no line names its speaker | ✅ static | ENGINE §16 "Subtitle line clock", "Subtitle record format" |

| Sliders | Music slider = group 1 (menu theme, level music, stingers); Effects slider = group 4, 70 of 80 groups incl. Lara's voice and hint lines; Speech slider = group 7, only cutscene speech (25) and a few DLC 2 lines | ✅ | Befund-Ton-Gruppen-0611 |
| Ambience | Group 15 with 16-24: loops 19, animals 20, fire 21, wind / storm 22, water 23, underwater 24. DLC 2 ambience beds run in the music group | ✅ | Befund-Ton-Gruppen-0611; Befund-W6-Toene-1411 |
| HUD sounds | Group 53: binoculars 54, Lara special 55 (heartbeat, adrenaline time bend, rewards, targeting), menu 56, PDA 57; Lara's hint lines 70 sit under the PDA group | ✅ | Befund-Ton-Gruppen-0611 |
| PDA / sonar sounds | Group 57 itself holds only the 8 PDA waves 909-916; muting the whole group also mutes Lara's hint lines (child group 70). The steady sonar hum is most likely section 3381 `computer_hum` (waves 914 / 915, the only two-wave sound there) | ✅ data / hum 🔶 | ENGINE §18.2; Befund-Tonanzeige-1411 |
| Pause / death | The pause menu pauses groups 6, 25, 3, 9 (+79 on TU); Lara's death silences groups 70 and 76 | ✅ | ENGINE §18.3 |
| Effects | Groups 58 / 59 carry a ParamEQ. TU group 77 = echo (500 ms; DLC 2 player's voice in bad water / drowning), 78 = chorus (75 ms; her body foley) | ✅ data | ENGINE §18.3 "Game DSP kinds" |
| 3D falloff | A 3D sound is full inside 158 units, silent beyond 3161 units, squared falloff between (defaults) | ✅ static | ENGINE §18.3 "Why the group 78 voices sit at volume 0" |
| Streams | Cutscene, voice, event and music streams (`.mul`) use the game's own IMA ADPCM decoder; DLC 1 / 2 have 25 music tracks | ✅ | ENGINE §18.4 |
| Speech languages | Speech exists in EN / FR / DE / IT / ES; Dutch has text only (English speech). Mercenary barks (490 lines) exist only in the ship units | ✅ data | ENGINE §18.5 "Language census", §18.5 |
| Checkpoint chime | Base checkpoints chime in group 55 (pauses with the pause menu), DLC 1 units in group 5 (does not) | ✅ data / effect 🔶 | ENGINE §1 "Checkpoint chime DTP 906 / PC 3512" |
| Sound source | Every wave sound knows the emitter that started it, and an animation sound knows the character it belongs to at the moment it is created - but the game never keeps that link afterwards for most animation sounds (only some stay in the character's sound list) | ✅ static | ENGINE §18.2 "Exact voice -> emitter -> instance" |
| Mute / pause / loop | The sound engine keeps its own "muted" state per channel (set by a muted group above it as well), its own pause and whether the channel loops; a muted group also silences sounds that start in it later | ✅ static | ENGINE §18.3 "FMOD's own channel state" |
| Channels outside the voice list | A few sounds (the oscillator sound type) play on channels the game's voice list never sees; only a group mute or the channel itself reaches them | ✅ static / live 🔶 | ENGINE §18.3 "FMOD's own channel state"; Befund-FMOD-Kanaele-1411 |

## 10. Options and controls

| Registry | Settings live under `HKCU\Software\Crystal Dynamics\Tomb Raider: Underworld` (root values, `Graphics` and `Input` keys); a missing value reads as 0 (e.g. depth of field off) | ✅ static | ENGINE §16 "Graphics settings" |
| Saving settings | Settings are written only on a clean exit; a crash or killed process keeps the old values | ✅ static | ENGINE §16 "Settings save" |
| Subtitle language | Stored per profile; -1 = same as the game language; a change applies to the next line | ✅ live | ENGINE §16 "Subtitle language at run time" |
| Languages | Text tables EN / FR / DE / IT / ES / NL in PC 1.1; one bitmap font (205 glyphs incl. pad icons) for all; line wrap only at spaces | ✅ | ENGINE §16 "Bitmap font" |

| Keyboard | Keys are bound to pad codes, not actions: registry `Input` value name = pad code, data = source codes (keyboard 0x80 + scan code, mouse 0x60-0x62) | ✅ | ENGINE §21 "Keyboard = pad code (Q108)" |
| Key actions | R3 = adrenaline mode, X (held) = vault-off strike, LT = lock, RT = fire, L3 = centre camera, LB / RB = shadow power (DLC 2) | ✅ | ENGINE §21, §22 "Centre-camera button" |
| Button prompts | On PC prompts show the bound button's name instead of the pad icon (Back shows the word BACK); stick icons stay icons (only DLC texts still use them; the PC rewrote its base hints) | ✅ static | ENGINE §16 "Button glyphs in text (Q9)", "Stick glyphs in DLC hints (W7)" |
| Auto-recenter | The camera recentres 5 s after the last look input, over a 2 s ramp; any mouse pause restarts the delay | ✅ static | ENGINE §22 "Auto-recenter" |

## 11. Saves, stickies, rewards, achievements

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slots | 10 save slots (`savegame00..09.sav`, 1.25 MB each) plus `profile.pro`; a save overwrites its slot in place, no temporary file | ✅ static | ENGINE §6.2 "Save file I/O (Q69)", §23 "Photo system gate" |
| Checkpoints | A checkpoint is an in-memory snapshot of the live save area; death restores it | ✅ | ENGINE §6.4 "Checkpoint = copy" |
| Saved content | Units, instances, the game block (unit, checkpoint, play time in s, chapter, costume, options), stickies, dead bits; not saved: plain script variables | ✅ | ENGINE §6.1, §6.2 |
| Save names | "<LEVEL> - <chapter>"; the game block's chapter field was 0 in all 14 saves read | ✅ data | ENGINE §8.2 "Chapter title card" |
| Stickies | Persistent script values: 512 int, 4096 bool, 128 float; keys grow in creation order | ✅ | ENGINE §6.3 |
| Restore rules | A saved object waits until its object and its linked parent exist; one that never restores stays gone and keeps its placed copy suppressed; a missing inventory item stays missing | ✅ static | ENGINE §6.4 "Restore order", "Birth suppression", "Inventory restore" |
| Rewards | 179 treasures + 6 relics = 185, each placed once: Med 26, Thailand 30, Manor 13, Mexico 50, Jan Mayen 30, Arctic 30 treasures, one relic in each; each pickup sets its bit once | ✅ data + log | ENGINE §6.4 "Reward collected bits + table (P1)" |
| Health pickups | `*_rw_shard` rewards are health pickups and are not counted | ✅ data | ENGINE §6.4 "Reward collected bits + table (P1)" |
| Achievements on PC | PC 1.1 has no achievements: the script natives are empty and the scripts check an "is Xbox" flag that is false | ✅ | ENGINE §7.2 "achievement (script 66)", "corebase f15 / f16" |
| Exe achievements (Xbox) | Treasures 10 / 50 / 100 / all, relics 1 / 3 / 6, two / three kills with one grenade, vehicle kills 1 / 5, adrenaline headshots 1 / 10, chapter ends, chimney-jump counts | ✅ static | ENGINE §7.2 "Exe-awarded achievements (I-4)" |
| Timed achievements | Ballcourt < 45 s, Valgrind < 50 s, Valaskjalf entry < 40 s - all three in one adventure gives one more; three swan-dive spots count 1 / 2 / 3 🔶 | ✅ static | ENGINE §7.2 "GameGlobals (script 5) achievement checks (I-3)" |

## 12. Menus, DLC offer, costumes, difficulty

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ring menu | One script for main and pause menu: 7 ring slots (new game, options, load, save, audio / visual, extras, slot 7) + centre (play / resume) | ✅ static | ENGINE §8.2 "Ring menu slot 7" |
| Slot 7 | Slot 7 is Quit Game or Downloadable Content (sub-ring: play mission, community info, download content); PC 1.1 shows Quit in both menus. Bottom position 14 is the Xbox storage-device entry, unused on PC | ✅ static | ENGINE §8.2 "Ring menu slot 7", "Ring geometry: 14 positions" |
| Mission screen | Lists only installed DLC; the slots for missions 3-6 have placeholder texts / images but can never appear. Title light blue over the description | ✅ | ENGINE §4.1 "Units without a DRM"; DLC_MENU.md |
| Outfits | Offered only when the costume file exists (no unlock flag); the outfit selection appears on a mission / level start, not on story transitions | ✅ | ENGINE §19; DLC2.md "Xbox reference" |
| Costume packs | Wetsuit pack: Wetsuit, Blue Wetsuit; Classic pack: Classic Lara, Legend Lara; Designer pack: Fashion Winner, People's Choice | ✅ data | COSTUMES.md |
| Difficulty | Player tailoring = EnemyHP, AmmoAdj, PlayerHP, SavingGrabAdj and a fifth value; each 0-2, 1 = Medium (default) | ✅ static | Befund-DLC-Schwierigkeit-1111 |
| TU mission start | Starting a DLC mission on the TU resets tailoring to Medium and the chosen costume; DLC 2+ starts skip the outfit selection. PC 1.1 keeps both and always offers outfits | ✅ static / PC live | ENGINE §4.2 "Dialog accept case 8"; Befund-Hauptmenue-Schwierigkeit-1111 |
| Mission start vs direct level change | A mission start (the menu's way into a level) starts with fresh game data and clears the chosen outfit, so the level's own default outfit loads - in DLC 2 that is the Doppelgänger, which only then becomes the player. A direct level change keeps the game data and the current outfit, so DLC 2 entered that way has Lara in her current outfit and no Doppelgänger. (The PC's own menu then lets the player pick an outfit again where its rule offers the selection) | ✅ static / live (direct change) | ENGINE §4.2 "PC mission start vs level.load: the DLC player" |
| DLC start from inside a level | The pause menu's DLC screen starts a DLC mission from a running level the same way as the main menu (fresh game data, the level's own outfit, DLC 2 with the Doppelgänger) - on the title update; the PC 1.1 code skips the reset and keeps the outfit. Afterwards it closes the pause screens. TruMenu 0.22.51 starts DLC 1 / DLC 2 from a level exactly this way (title-update rule) | ✅ static / ⬜ live | ENGINE §4.2 "DLC start from a level, replayed" |

## 13. Xbox vs PC and the title update (game level)

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| TU = DLC base | The DLCs were built for title update 0.0.2.3; its exe code (504 new, 824 changed functions) holds the shadow power, rock veins, DLC 2 damage types and thrall companions. PC 1.1 is retail-based | ✅ | ENGINE §1 "TU coverage list" |
| Base-game data | The TU changes no base level, enemy or player data - only append-only lists (camera ids, 6 input bindings, sound groups) and some menu texts / UI sounds | ✅ data | ENGINE §1 "Base-game DATA in the TU (Q60)" |
| TU fixes | TU code blocks match the published fix list: jump targeting, ledge corners, edge probe by stick direction, faster trigger tests; the Legend cheat poll was removed | 🔶 | ENGINE §1 "Main-game bug fixes in the TU" |
| DLC 2 hits | PC 1.1 knows damage types 0-16 only, so DLC 2 hits do nothing and thralls never die | ✅ live | ENGINE §13.3 |
| Combo | On the TU every combo punch can hit the same thrall again; on PC 1.1 only the first punch of a chain hits | ✅ static + log | ENGINE §1 "Lara's punch combo (K-8)" |
| Punch impulse | The TU skips the push impulse after Lara's punch on thralls, so they stay in their hit reaction; PC 1.1 throws them into a fall on every punch | ✅ live | ENGINE §1 "Impulse 0x91 after Lara's contact hit (K-1b)" |
| Finisher | TU steers the finisher Y onto the target every frame and kills it at the end; PC 1.1 leaps by root motion and does not kill | ✅ static / PC live | ENGINE §12 "Finisher Y move", "State 1015" |
| Dismemberment | TU builds the pieces in the death state (limit 8); PC 1.1 builds them inside the physics step (limit 4), which can end in a fatal "failed to create geom" | ✅ live | ENGINE §13.6 "Crash root cause" |
| Collision pairs | TU sizes the markup collision pool at 3000 boxes / 1000 pair links, PC 1.1 at 1000 / 400 | ✅ | ENGINE §1 "SweepAndPrune pool" |
| Slow-motion camera | Under the shadow power the TU camera, camera shake, braid and some player steps run at normal speed; on PC they would run at world speed 0.3 | ✅ static | ENGINE §20.4, §20.5, §22 "Camera time step (TU)" |
| DLC 2 camera | TU uses own camera settings for the Doppelganger (recenter after 0.25 s, 5 s ramp; new climb modes) | ✅ (Xenia) | ENGINE §22 "Doppelganger camera settings (TU)" |
| Rendering | The Xbox has per-object and camera motion blur, absent on PC; depth of field is complete in the PC exe but off unless the registry value is set | ✅ static | ENGINE §1 "Motion blur", "Depth of field" |
| Back icon | The Xbox draws the Back pad icon in prompts; the PC shows a word | ✅ | ENGINE §16 "Button glyphs in text (Q9)" |

## 14. Original game bugs known on PC

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 31 CPU threads | The CPU count loop never ends when bit 31 of the affinity mask is set and overruns a stack array; with 25+ worker threads the first load hangs. Up to 24 workers run | ✅ static + live | ENGINE §3 "CPU count / > 31-thread start-up crash", "Worker pool" |
| Release walk crash | When a big unload (e.g. the death reload in the pillory area, five units at once) frees resources and a destructor adds one more past the list capacity, the release walk reads freed memory and crashes | ✅ (dump) | ENGINE §16 "Deferred release list (W1 / PT.1)" |
| Stale pause after menu exit | Leaving to the main menu from the pause screen keeps the pause bit; all menu clocks then run at half speed (attract teaser after ~80 s). Same code on the Xbox | ✅ static + live | ENGINE §23 "Script clock time step / stale pause bit" |
| Mouse switches targets | While hard-locked any mouse movement counts as a right-stick push and switches the lock-on target | ✅ static | ENGINE §13.7 "Lock-on target switch (Q68)" |
| Finisher off the edge | The retail finisher leap can carry Lara past a target at an arena edge and out of the world (seen in hall02); the TU's target steering avoids it | ✅ live / TU 🔶 | Befund-Sturz-durch-Welt-1111 |
| Save abort | A failed save write deletes the slot file (no temporary copy) | ✅ static | ENGINE §6.2 "Save file I/O (Q69)" |
| Frame-rate pushes | One-frame physics pushes given as forces get weaker at high frame rates | 🔶 | ENGINE §13.6 "Frame-rate sensitivity (Q69)" |

| Topic | Fact | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Photo feature | A full screenshot system (100 photo slots, JPEG quality 85, PDA photo inbox, upload), seven Lara photo poses and an unpublished Xbox achievement "Photo Archaeologist" exist; a gate byte that nothing sets keeps it off, the field camera only zooms | ✅ static | ENGINE §23 "Screenshot / photo system", "Photo system gate (Q78)" |
| Key items | Ten cut key items keep names and descriptions in the text tables (gem, jewel, stone headdress, four house keys, Xibalba key, jaguar head, Helheim power stone); the puzzle objects exist, no inventory page shows them | ✅ data / 🔶 meaning | Befund-Unbenutzte-Inhalte-Q66-1111 |

| Cheats | The Legend cheat-code poll is still active on PC (removed by the TU); a `co_rock` cheat object in `l1_seafloor` waits for an input sequence; "infinite adrenaline" is empty on PC | ✅ / sequence 🔶 | ENGINE §23 "Legend cheat poll", "co_rock cheat object" |
| Unlockables | Script natives for unlockable music and costumes exist but no script calls them | ✅ | ENGINE §23 "Unreferenced native types (Q81)" |
