"""Offline model checks for TruMenu 0.17 (read-only; 2026-11-06 TruMenu 0.17 quick toggles).

The rules of three new TruMenu.cpp parts, re-implemented here line by line as a MODEL (this does not run the C++ code -
it checks that the rules themselves do what the build report claims):
  1. depth   DpMapping's six view forms (row / column, camera-relative, of the inverse) with a least-squares scale k over
             five test points, |k| = 1 first, the first candidate whose projection passes (incl. the 0.17 span rule):
             for random cameras every form x scale x handedness is built from the true camera and must be accepted with
             the right z for 5 random points; one frame of lag (20 units / 0.5 degrees) must be accepted; views of
             unrelated cameras (depth axis > 10 degrees off) must be refused - at most 1 % coincidental fits pass.
  2. chord   QbPad's chord window: both combo buttons in one poll, staggered inside ChordMs, a lone tap (released early:
             the game gets a 100 ms tap), a lone hold (the game gets it late), the open bar owning D-pad / LB / RB, a
             D-pad held at the close staying away until released.
  3. frames  pos.go's conversion target = saved - P(saved) + P(now) against the memory dump numbers of
             docs/Befund-Position-und-Schrotflinte.md (test 50h: live - data = -V + P per unit).
2026-11-06 TruMenu 0.18 adds two models:
  4. segments  shot.oncine's segments (OnCineTick / OcSegReason / OcSegStart): the live case 18:12:56 - 18:16:00 (0.17
             rules: one cutscene, 10 pairs used up after ~35 s; 0.18: a second segment with pairs in the exterior part),
             a cinematic object appearing after the camera signal (adopted, no new segment), a script print and the 1 s
             minimum, a unit name differing only in case (no change), the 2 s end debounce.
  5. confirm   the bar's second-press confirmation (QbConfirm / QbArmed: same key within 3 s).
2026-11-07 TruMenu 0.21.1 changes model "labels" (only a drawn placed instance suppresses its runtime copies) and adds
six: killpath (AkPick / the Kill outcome), sticky (StParse / RunStickySet), roomcheck (RkCheck / player.goto / unit.go),
unitgo (the shortcut step expansion), favrecent (page 0, QbRecentAdd, [Quick] Recent), groups (QbBuild / QbGroupSet).
2026-11-07 TruMenu 0.21.2 / TruShadowPower 0.19 add two (docs/Befund-Padkette-StartView-0711.md):
  padchain  the three pad hooks (TruMenu PadHook, TruShadowPower PadHook, TruLink PadHook with its re-entry breaker) in
            all six orders; a queued item that polls the pad again (cheat.flight 0): with the 0.21.1 rule (item always
            inside PadHook) TruLink cuts the chain in the orders where it sits outermost (TruMenu then drops out, the
            bar combo's Start reaches the game); with the 0.21.2 rule (inside PadHook only when the game called it,
            else in Present) no order cuts the chain, the item runs once and the game never sees Start of the combo.
  padblock  TruShadowPower 0.19 GameButtons with TruMenuPadBlock, the plugin inside and outside TruMenu: quick bar
            LB / RB taps, RB held through the bar close, RB pressed in the long menu (neutral pad) and held through
            its close - never counted; plain RB before / after - counted.
2026-11-07 TruMenu 0.21.3 extends chord (X / Y owned by the open bar, passed while closed, one held at the close kept until
released) and adds four (docs/Befund-TruMenu-0213-0711.md):
  xyfav     Y = QbFavPin / FavSet: pin / unpin toggled by item id (two rows of one item, 500 random presses: never twice;
            a hand-edited double goes as a whole), page 0 refreshed at once (into Favoriten, out of Zuletzt and back),
            rows with an argument / headings / groups / planned / special rows refused, Y beats X / right in one frame.
  xyexec    X = QbExecRow: action / choice / info / special rows = the right press, so every confirmation row (ai.kill,
            ai.remove, level.reload, sticky.set, chapters, spawn, checkpoint go) needs X X / X right / right X within 3 s;
            X + right in one frame counts once; game.quit arms itself (10 s); bool rows toggle; value rows nothing;
            groups open / close.
  footer    the bar's second footer line "X: ausfuehren  Y: Favorit   View + Start: zu" (EN), kept under a result.
  sndwidth  DrawSoundList with AlwaysAutoResize: the 0.21 right-corner shift kept the widest width ever, 0.21.3 aligns
            to this frame's widest row (left corners unchanged, a too long row cut at 70 %).
2026-11-07 TruMenu 0.21.4 adds three (docs/Befund-TruMenu-0214-0711.md, docs/Befund-Hall02-Zaehler-Drift-0711.md):
  h2drift   the dispatcher 11270 counter (24540 f3 / f4 / f1) with the thrall int +8 (generator birth = 2, checkpoint
            restore = 0): the live session 15:49 - 15:53 (4 pre-spawned thralls in checkpoint 11258, two deaths) ends
            with population 4 and the wall closed - exactly the measured lines.
  fixhall02 RunFixHall02: refused in another unit, without dispatcher values, with the wall broken, with a living
            object-1004 thrall (alive / Regenerate / RegenerateDeath / no brain but not hidden); allowed when every one is
            in Death / LandDeath / DrownDeath / DeferredInstantDie / kill flag / gone / hidden without a brain; tutorial
            2 only when below 2 and before population 0; then f1 (trigger 11268 enter / leave) breaks the wall in the
            drift case, never before the fix.
  scriptval H2ValueAddr = the interpreter's op14 address ([R+0xc] + 8, 0 when R or [R+0xc] is 0) for 2000 random
            memories; op2f skips a 0 address, so a read through H2ValueAddr never touches what the game would not.
2026-11-06 TruMenu 0.19 dumb AI adds three models (section "---- 0.19 dumb AI" of TruMenu.cpp):
  6. presets   RunAiDumb / AiPresetOn / RadialOn: ring and bar rows "ai.dumb <preset>" get "<preset> 0|1" from the shown
             state; one setting at a time (a group replaces the other), "<preset> 0" switches off only its own active
             setting, "" / "1" bring the last setting back (also an own list), "filter" = [AI] DumbFilter.
  7. burst     AiSecondTick's log rule at 60 frames per second: per-frame removals never give more than one line per
             burst end, a long burst one line every 30 s, a pause under 2 s keeps the burst, 2 s ends it.
  8. bits      AiBitsSet / AiBitsSweep: only the brain+8 bits TruMenu set are cleared again (a bit the game set stays),
             a bit the game clears is set again while on, out of scope / off clears TruMenu's bits, a gone brain drops
             its record without a write.
2026-11-06 TruMenu 0.20 changes model 4 and adds three models:
  4. segments  (0.20) OcSegReason no longer starts a segment on a TRACK change of the same cinematic object (the track
             is followed): the live case 20:23 (track 0 -> 28 -> 60 -> 92 .. once a second = a new pair every second
             with the 0.18 rule) must give ONE segment; a new cinematic object, a unit change and a script print still
             start one (the 0.18 cases keep their results).
  9. goload    RunPosGoLoad's path: loaded -> flight + pos.go; not loaded with a portal of a loaded unit (portal name =
             the target unit, case-insensitive, never the target's own portals) -> flight + pos.portal + wait.unit +
             pos.go; no such portal or "load" -> level.load + flight + pos.go.
 10. waitunit  ShortcutTick's wait.unit: the unit must be loaded 1 s in a row (a flicker restarts the second), at most
             30 s, then the run stops with the reason.
 11. forget    AiForgetOnce: once per enemy {instance, handle id} and setting; a new setting / ai.dumb off / a level
             change forgets again; the slot rule (mode 1 = Lara's handle, mode 0 = a sense whose target is Lara, mode -1 /
             2 / another target untouched); +0x30 / +0xf0 cleared, +0x70 / +0xb0 only counted.
2026-11-06 TruMenu 0.20.1 sound list adds two models (section "---- 0.20.1 sound list" of TruMenu.cpp):
 12. soundlist SnBuild / SnClassify / SnState / DrawSoundList: the wave id rule (manager + 8, 0x18 steps, 0x1400 waves),
             the group = the first ancestor node that is a group node (root 0 only when nothing else), the category by
             the ancestors (music = [cats+0] or [cats+0xc], SFX [1], speech [2], else other), the state precedence
             (ending > starting > muted > paused > virtual > playing), the filter (groups, audible only), the three
             orders (group / volume / name = streams first, then the wave id) and the line limit.
 13. mutemusic SmMusicGroups / SmMuteOn / SmMuteOff: the music groups are [cats+0] and [cats+0xc] (never SFX / speech /
             the root, no duplicate); a group is muted once (not again while muted), a group muted by someone else is
             never touched, a level load's new channel group is muted once more, no groups (loading) keeps the
             records, off unmutes only TruMenu's groups and only when the channel group is the same object and still
             muted (a rebuilt group is left alone) - no volume is ever written.

2026-11-07 TruMenu 0.21 adds six models (section "---- 0.21 arachnophobia" of TruMenu.cpp, M20Draw):
 14. spiders   ArKindOf: Match / Exclude parts on the object name (giant = its own kind, generators excluded), a name the
             object list does not know yet is not cached, the INI list normalised as AiNormList.
 15. wobble    ArDrawPictures' quad: centre = spot - bob, |bob| <= amp x size, squash / stretch on the sides, the tilt
             keeps the side lengths, the longer side = size, a still picture is axis-aligned, flip swaps only the UVs,
             phases differ per instance.
 16. drawmask  ArDrawHook: V1 sets +0x23c = -1 only during the game's draw and puts the value back (one the game wrote
             meanwhile stays), a spider the game hides is untouched, V2 writes no mask (0x200 + counter), picture-only /
             off / other instances draw normally.
 17. shake     CsShakeStub = the game's strength x ShakeScale / 100; a refused patch group is tried once until switched.
 18. labels    one label per reward pot (runtime child with the parent's intro dropped when the placed one is in the walk,
             the spawned artifact kept), LfNotDrawn (0x800, 0x20, scene entity off, +0x23c | +0x240 == -1).
 19. airemove  RunAdRemove's selection (others / nearest / all / intro id) and AdCandidate's filter.

Usage (from the repository root):
  ../bin/pyt -t 120 tools/trumenu_quick_check.py            all models, exit 1 on a failure
0.21.5 (2026-11-07 Fixes + frozen ring): switches (SwNext / RunSwSet: bool / int / choice steps, X toggle / wrap,
listed key, type, INI exists, unchanged = no write, live / restart / live-if), swfold (one group open at a time,
largest page <= 64 rows; 0.22.23: the shipped file's groups, kQbViewMax 128), ringparity (every ring entry of the
shipped file is a bar row, ring frozen at 172).
0.22.23 (Q39 switches file limit): swcap (SwLoadLocked with kSwMax 512 / kSwGroupMax 24: lines over a limit are not
shown, counted with the first line number for one log line per kind, rows below a group over the limit belong to no
group; QbSwRows: rows the page cannot hold are counted for the head note; the old 160 cap as negative model).
0.22.24 (Q36 fall watch / fall net): fallnet (FallWatchTick / FallNetTick / FwLineOk: the Q19 fall of 2026-11-10 with
the gravity of the finding (-5,151 u/s^2, start at rest ~2,100 units below the floor) at 30 frames/s - the net's first
rescue after 3 s in record 1068, at most 3 per fall with older samples when she keeps falling (worst case: velocity kept,
no floor), one fall-end line when the floor holds her, FallNet=0 one "would" line, the menu open = one waiting line
and the rescue after the close, a normal jump = no watchdog line / no rescue, a 10 s frame gap counts 100 ms, the
watchdog every 1 s / every 10 s after 30 s, 40 watch lines per 10 s with the dropped count in the next line, samples of
another unit / taken after the fall began never used; the constants and rule lines are read from TruMenu.cpp).
0.21.6 (2026-11-07 costumes / flight line / quick command line): cosbar (QbCosRows: 4 rows + the open list from the
cycle list, the current costume marked, every row refused without a level, labels "<slot> <text> (<object>)" only for
dlc_costume_a..p, records only with an object id; page / row limits: own page <= 64 rows for any list up to 60, the
Lara page would overflow, 16 pages), cosdebounce (QbCosAct / QbCosTick: a step only picks, the switch runs once the
pick stood 0.5 s - tapping / holding switches once; X = now; wraps at both ends; the negative model "switch on every
step" is caught), flighthint (FlightHintWanted truth table, the line above the bottom-right windows, never overlapping),
quickcmd (QcPadTick: L3 alone toggles, L3 + R3 / ring hold never, bar / menu / ring close it, A runs once per press,
B closes, D-pad history = the menu bar's walk, 4 answers newest first, one run path), togglerows (the pass / Navmesh
rows are bool rows: right = on, left = off, X flips; NavRowNote's "(Ebene fehlt)" / "(nur mit Flaechen)" rule; every
shipped toggle row is a bool row).
